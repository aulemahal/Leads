abstract = {The cold upper halcoline of the Arctic Ocean is maintained by large-scale lateral advection from the adjoining continental shelves, where dense and saline shelf water is produced during freezing; the salinization of the water column is especially pronounced in certain areas of persistent ice divergence. Estimates show the annual rate at which the dense shelf water feeds into the Polar Basin is probably in the neighborhood of 2.5 x 106m3s-1; this is of the same order as the inflow of warm and saline water from the Atlantic. A consequence of this process is that the halocline must be a heat sink for the underlying Atlantic water, thereby shielding the ice cover from an upward heat flux. The Atlantic water is thus linked rather directly to the enormous shelf seas that border the Polar Basin. Proposed massive river diversions in the Arctic could, by increasing the shelf salinities and driving a deeper flow into the interior, cause a thinning of the halocline and place the Atlantic water in more direct contact with the surface mixed layer. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {A coupled global climate model is used to evaluate processes that determine the equilibrium location of the sea-ice edge and its climatological annual cycle. The extent to which the wintertime ice edge departs from a symmetric ring around either pole depends primarily on coastlines, ice motion, and the melt rate at the ice-ocean interface. At any location the principal drivers of the oceanic heat flux that melts sea ice are absorbed solar radiation and the convergence of heat transported by ocean currents. The distance between the ice edge and the pole and the magnitude of the ocean heat flux convergence at the ice edge are inversely related. The chief exception to this rule is in the East Greenland Current, where the ocean heat flux convergence just east of the ice edge is relatively high but ice survives due to its swift southward motion and the protection of the cold southward-flowing surface water. In regions where the ice edge extends relatively far equatorward, absorbed solar radiation is the largest component of the ocean energy budget, and the large seasonal range of insolation causes the ice edge to traverse a large distance. In contrast, at relatively high latitudes, the ocean heat flux convergence is the largest component and it has a relatively small annual range, so the ice edge traverses a much smaller distance there. When the model is subject to increased CO2 forcing up to twice preindustrial levels, the ocean heat flux convergence weakens near the ice edge in most places. This weakening reduces the heat flux from the ocean to the base of the ice and tends to offset the effects of increased radiative forcing at the ice surface, so the ice edge retreats less than it would otherwise.},

The air is assumed unsaturated. A total of either 16000 or 32000 grid points was used in a three-dimensional region with length and width several times the height of the boundary layer. A key result is the irrelevance of the neutral height scale, u*/f, and its replacement by the height zi of the inversion base which confines the convective mixing when -zi/L is as small as 1.5 (L is the Monin-Obukhov length). Shapes of the eddies are examined for -zi/L=0, 1.5, 4.5 and 45; and only for the two slightly unstable cases were the vertical velocity eddies distinctly elongated as in Ekman-layer theories. At large instabilities it is shown how the friction velocity u* loses its influence upon the turbulence intensities and a convective velocity scale becomes important. Vertical profiles of mean wind, potential temperature, momentum flux, gross eddy coefficients, flux correlation coefficients, turbulence intensities, temperature variance and pressure fluctuations are presented and compared, when possible, with measurements},

abstract = {We present simulations performed with a three dimensional global ocean general circulation model which show that simulated salinities and amounts of convective mixing are very sensitive to vertical mixing of surface buoyancy fluxes. If, as usual, surface buoyancy fluxes are placed entirely in the topmost model level, our model produces excessive convective mixing in the Southern Ocean. This results in poor stimulated salinity in the Southern Ocean. In this simulation, we assume, as usual, that both surface buoyancy forcing and vertical mixing are homogeneous within each grid cell. If, on the other hand, destabilizing surface fluxes are instantaneously mixed into the subsurface ocean, the model produces much less convective mixing and much more realistic salinities. The vertical mixing of surface buoyancy fluxes performed in this simulation is equivalent to assuming that those fluxes affect only a small fraction of each grid cell, and cause vertical mixing only in that limited area. Our interpretation of these results is that the usual assumption that both surface buoyancy forcing and vertical mixing are uniform within each grid cell has a detrimental effect on model results; these results could be significantly improved by good parametrizations which treat the horizontal inhomogeneity of surface buoyancy forcing and of vertical mixing},

These problems are eliminated in our ''test'' simulation, in which we distribute rejected salt uniformly over the upper 160 m. Also, the strength of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is more realistic in this simulation. These results show the need for, but do not provide, a better representation of sinking of rejected salt. The sensitivity of our model to sinking of rejected salt suggests that a similar sensitivity may exist in the real ocean, and that loss of Antarctic sea ice might have major effects},

The reasons for this failure of models is argued to be a lack of information about the turbulence structure. A new tensor quantity, the structure tensor, is defined and shown to be of critical importance in the rotation problem. The physical reasons for the effects of rotation are explained, and a simple model that does display the effects is proposed.},

These events have decreasing September ice extent trends that are typically 4 times larger than comparable observed trends. One event exhibits a decrease from 6 million km2 to 2 million km2 in a decade, reaching near ice-free September conditions by 2040. In the simulations, ice retreat accelerates as thinning increases the open water formation efficiency for a given melt rate and the ice-albedo feedback increases shortwave absorption. The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing. Analysis from multiple climate models and three forcing scenarios indicates that abrupt reductions occur in simulations from over 50{\%} of the models and suggests that reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions moderate the likelihood of these events.},

abstract = {Sea ice in the Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean has decreased significantly in recent years, and this will likely change the properties of the surface waters. A near-surface temperature maximum (NSTM) at typical depths of 25–35 m has been previously described; however, its formation mechanisms, seasonal evolution, and interannual variability have not been established. Based on summertime conductivity, temperature, and depth surveys and year-round Ice-Tethered Profiler data from 2005 to 2008, we found that the NSTM forms when sufficient solar radiation warms the upper ocean. A seasonal halocline forms in summer once enough sea ice melt has accumulated to separate the surface mixed layer from the NSTM. The NSTM becomes trapped below the summer halocline, thereby storing heat from solar radiation. This heat can be stored year-round in the Canada Basin if the halocline is strong enough to persist through winter. In addition, energy from storm-driven mixing can weaken the summer halocline and entrain the NSTM, thereby melting sea ice in winter. Throughout this cycle, Ekman pumping within the convergent Beaufort Gyre acts to deepen the NSTM. From 1993 through 2007, the NSTM warmed and expanded northward and both the NSTM and the summer halocline formed at successively shallower depths. North of 75°N, the temperature of the NSTM increased from 2004 to 2007 by 0.13°C/yr, and the NSTM and summer halocline shoaled by 2.1 m/yr and 1.7 m/yr, respectively, from 1997 to 2007. The formation and dynamics of the NSTM are manifestations of both the ice-albedo feedback effect and changes to the freshwater cycle in the Canada Basin.},

abstract = {If model parameterizations of unresolved physics, such as the variety of upper ocean mixing processes, are to hold over the large range of time and space scales of importance to climate, they must be strongly physically based. Observations, theories, and models of oceanic vertical mixing are surveyed. Two distinct regimes are identified: ocean mixing in the boundary layer near the surface under a variety of surface forcing conditions (stabilizing, destabilizing, and wind driven), and mixing in the ocean interior due to internal waves, shear instability, and double diffu-sion (arising from the different molecular diffusion rates of heat and salt). Mixing schemes commonly applied to the upper ocean are shown not to contain some potentially important boundary layer physics. Therefore a new parameterization of oceanic bound-ary layer mixing is developed to accommodate some of this physics. It includes a scheme for determining the boundary layer depth h, where the turbulent contribu-tion to the vertical shear of a bulk Richardson number is parameterized. Expressions for diffusivity and non-local transport throughout the boundary layer are given. The diffusivity is formulated to agree with sim-ilarity theory of turbulence in the surface layer and is subject to the conditions that both it and its vertical gradient match the interior values at h. This nonlocal "K profile parameterization" (KPP) is then verified and compared to alternatives, including its atmo-spheric counterparts.

abstract = {We have implemented the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) method to solve the sea ice momentum equation with a viscous-plastic (VP) formulation. The JFNK method has many advantages: the system matrix (the Jacobian) does not need to be formed and stored, the method is parallelizable and the convergence can be nearly quadratic in the vicinity of the solution. The convergence rate of our JFNK implementation is characterized by two phases: an initial phase with slow convergence and a fast phase for which the residual norm decreases significantly from one Newton iteration to the next. Because of this fast phase, the computational gain of the JFNK method over the standard solver used in existing VP models increases with the required drop in the residual norm (termination criterion). The JFNK method is between 3 and 6.6 times faster (depending on the spatial resolution and termination criterion) than the standard solver using a preconditioned generalized minimum residual method. Resolutions tested in this study are 80, 40, 20 and 10 km. For a large required drop in the residual norm, both JFNK and standard solvers sometimes do not converge. The failure rate for both solvers increases as the grid is refined but stays relatively small (less than 2.3{\%} of failures). With increasing spatial resolution, the velocity gradients (sea ice deformations) get more and more important. Nonlinear solvers such as the JFNK method tend to have difficulties when there are such sharp structures in the solution. This lack of robustness of both solvers is however a debatable problem as it mostly occurs for large required drops in the residual norm. Furthermore, when it occurs, it usually affects only a few grid cells, i.e., the residual is small for all the velocity components except in very localized regions. Globalization approaches for the JFNK solver, such as the line search method, have not yet proven to be successful. Further investigation is needed. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A one-dimensional thermodynamic model of sea ice is presented that includes the effects of snow cover, ice salinity, and internal heating due to penetration of solar radiation. Surface-energy balances determine rates of ablation and accretion; diffusion equations govern heat transport within the ice and snow. The incoming radiative and turbulent fluxes, oceanic heat flux, ice salinity, snow accumulation, and surface albedo are specified as functions of time. Starting from an arbitrary initial condition, the model is integrated numerically until annual equilibrium patterns of temperature and thickness are achieved. The model is applied to the central Arctic. Input values for the initial test of the model are based on observational data. Values predicted by the model for the average ice thickness (288 cm), amount of surface ablation (40 cm), and the temperature field all agree closely with field observations. Other results from the model indicate that, under present conditions, the ocean must supply 1 to 2 kcal/cm2 year to the ice; an additional 4 kcal/cm2 year would cause the ice to vanish. Annual snow depths less than 70 cm are shown to have little effect on equilibrium thickness; snow depths greater than 70 cm would result in much thicker ice. Comparison of observed and calculated temperature profiles suggest that about 2.0 to 2.5 kcal/cm2 year of the incoming short-wave radiation penetrates the ice and contributes to internal heating. Average ice albedos under 0.50 would cause the ice to vanish in a few years.},

abstract = {As part of a large interdisciplinary study of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA), we installed more than 135 ice thickness gauges to determine the sea ice mass balance. While installing these gauges during the fall of 1997, we found that much of the multiyear ice cover was only 1 m thick, considerably thinner than expected. Over the course of the yearlong field experiment we monitored the mass balance for a wide variety of ice types, including first-year ice, ponded ice, unponded ice, multiyear ice, hummocks, new ridges, and old ridges. Initial ice thicknesses for these sites ranged from 0.3 to 8 m, and snow depths varied from a few centimeters to more than a meter. However, for all of their differences and variety, these thickness gauges sites shared a common trait: at every site, there was a net thinning of the ice during the SHEBA year. The thin ice found in October 1997 was even thinner in October 1998. The annual cycle of ice thickness was also similar at all sites. There was a steady increase in thickness through the winter that gradually tapered off in the spring. This was followed by a steep drop off in thickness during summer melt and another tapering in late summer and early fall as freeze-up began. Maximum surface melting was in July, while bottom ablation peaked in August. Combining results from the sites, we found an average winter growth of 0.51 m and a summer melt of 1.26 m, which consisted of 0.64 m of surface melt and 0.62 m of bottom melt. There was a weak trend for thicker ice to have less winter growth and greater net loss for the year; however, ice growth was also impacted by the snow depth. Considerable variability was observed between sites in both accretion and ablation. The total accretion during the 9-month growth season ranged from zero for thick ridged ice to more than a meter for young ice. Ponds tended to have a large amount of surface melting, while ridges had considerable bottom ablation.},

abstract = {Fresh water from summer ice melt and the total freshwater content of the Arctic Ocean water column above the thermocline are estimated from vertical profiles of temperature and salinity observed on the I/B Oden 1991 cruise. The seasonal ice melt ranges from 0.5 m to slightly above 1 m and is moderately uniform over the observation area. Regions of lower melting are seen over the Morris Jesup Plateau. The freshwater content is calculated relative to the salinity just above the thermocline, north of the Barents Sea. The freshwater content increases toward the interior of the Arctic Ocean, showing that fresh water is advected from other regions into the observation area. Regions of different freshwater content are separated by fronts over the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge, over the Lomonosov Ridge, and in the western Eurasian Basin between waters derived from the Eurasian and Canadian Basins. Denser water, homogenized north of the Barents Sea, is recognized by a temperature minimum layer. The absence of the temperature minimum near the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge indicates that heat is transferred from the Atlantic Layer over a longer time than the shortest route would allow. This observation can be explained if the layer circulates together with the Atlantic Layer, i.e., toward the east and returns above the Nansen-Gakkel Ridge and along the Amundsen Basin. North of the Laptev Sea, this water formed north of the Barents Sea becomes covered by low-salinity shelf water. The increased freshwater content limits the winter convection, so it no longer reaches the thermocline and an intermediate halocline is formed. The halocline in the Eurasian Basin consists of water originating from winter convection in the Arctic Ocean north of the Barents Sea, which then circulates around the basin. Such a formation mechanism also explains the observed distribution of low NO water. The strong density increase limits vertical exchange, and the vertical diffusion coefficient in the halocline is small (similar to 1 x 10(-6) m(2) s(-1)). The increased temperature of the halocline shows that the heat lost upward by the Atlantic Layer, mainly by double-diffusive convection, is trapped below the mixed layer.},

abstract = {The distribution of dense brine under leads in sea ice is associated with convective sinking of individual plumes and near-surface mixing associated with ice-water momentum flux. The processes have been studied in the recent Lead Experiment (LeadEx) field program and previously modeled using a two-dimensional hydrostatic numerical model. In this study these processes are reexamined using a nonhydrostatic model. It is shown that nonhydrostatic effects give rise to pressure distributions which counter hydrostatic pressure gradients in the fluid. These effects are largest in sinking plume events and can be substantial when plumes are free to sink to depths of 100 m. In the presence of the Arctic halocline (typically at 30-40 m), however, vertical accelerations of convective plumes are limited spatially and temporally, and nonhydrostatic effects are relatively small. It is the purpose of this paper to demonstrate that for realistic Arctic stratification, convective circulations under leads in sea ice are predominantly hydrostatic.},

abstract = {Convection in the Arctic Ocean mixed layer occurs under openings in sea ice where new sea ice is formed. The process of brine rejection during ice formation creates negatively buoyant fluid at the surface of ice leads. When the fluid convects downward the ocean mixed layer below the lead is stirred vertically and, through planetary rotational effects, along-lead flows at the lead edges are induced. These vertical and lateral motions have been previously studied using two-dimensional numerical ocean models and observed in field programs such as LeadEx. In this paper the generation of Arctic Ocean eddies through dynamic instabilities is investigated using a three-dimensional, nonhydrostatic ocean model. Results suggest that salt- enriched vortices can develop at the base of the mixed layer as a consequence of brine rejection, but the vortex formation requires a time period of several days, a time long enough that the progenitor lead would likely have closed. The scale of the eddies is found to depend on the magnitude of the buoyancy forcing, the width of the lead, and the duration of the buoyancy forcing. The number of vortices produced depends on lead width and duration of buoyancy forcing but is less sensitive to the magnitude of the buoyancy forcing. Vortex sizes, scaled appropriately, and vortex numbers are compared with those found in recent laboratory studies of convectively driven flows from line segment sources.},

abstract = {We present a comparison of Arctic Ocean hydrographic data sets from the 1990s, with a focus on changes in the upper few hundred meters of the Eurasian Basin. The most recent observations discussed here were collected during the spring 1995 Scientific Ice Expedition (SCICEX'95), the second in a series of scientific cruises to the Arctic Ocean aboard U.S. Navy nuclear submarines. Although the 1990s have seen an abundance of synoptic cruises to the Arctic, this was the only one to take place in winter/spring conditions. Other data considered here were collected during the first SCICEX cruise in summer 1993 (SCICEX'93) and during an icebreaker cruise to the Eurasian Basin in summer 1991 (Oden'91). A new Russian-American winter climatology is also used as a reference. These comparisons reveal that the Eurasian Basin “cold halocline layer” has retreated during the 1990s to cover significantly less area than in previous years. Specifically, we find a retreat from the Amundsen Basin back into the Makarov Basin; the latter is the only region with a true cold halocline layer during SCICEX'95. Changes are also seen in other halocline types and in the Atlantic Water layer heat content and depth. Since the cold halocline layer insulates the surface layer (and thus the overlying sea ice) from the heat contained in the Atlantic Water layer, this should have profound effects on the surface energy and mass balance of sea ice in this region. Using a simple mixing model, we calculate maximum ice-ocean heat fluxes of 1–3 W m−2 in the Eurasian Basin, where during SCICEX'95 the surface layer lay in direct contact with the underlying Atlantic Water layer. The overall cause of water mass changes in the 1990s might have been a shift in the atmospheric wind forcing and resulting sea ice motion during the late 1980s, which we speculate influenced the location where fresh shelf waters flow into the deeper basins of the Arctic Ocean. Finally, we discuss two different mechanisms that have been proposed for cold halocline water formation, and we propose a compromise that best fits these data.},

On the basis of laboratory-derived double-diffusive flux laws, estimated vertical heat fluxes through the staircase are in the range 0.05–0.3Wm?2, only about one tenth of the estimated mean surface mixed layer heat flux to the sea ice. It is thus concluded that the vertical transport of heat from the Atlantic Water in the central basin is unlikely to have a significant impact to the Canada Basin ocean surface heat budget. Icebreaker conductivity-temperature-depth data from the Beaufort Gyre Freshwater Experiment show that the staircase is absent at the basin periphery. Turbulent mixing that presumably disrupts the staircase might drive greater flux from the Atlantic Water at the basin boundaries and possibly dominate the regionally averaged heat flux.},

abstract = {{\{}[{\}}1] Observations of the ocean, atmosphere, and ice made by Ice-Ocean$\backslash$nEnvironmental Buoys indicate that mixing events reaching the depth of$\backslash$nthe halocline have occurred in various regions in the Arctic Ocean. Our$\backslash$nanalysis suggests that these mixing events were mechanically forced by$\backslash$nintense storms moving across the buoy sites. In this study, we analyzed$\backslash$nthese mixing events in the context of storm developments that occurred$\backslash$nin the Beaufort Sea and in the general area just north of Fram Strait,$\backslash$ntwo areas with quite different hydrographic structures. The Beaufort Sea$\backslash$nis strongly influenced by inflow of Pacific water through Bering Strait,$\backslash$nwhile the area north of Fram Strait is directly affected by the inflow$\backslash$nof warm and salty North Atlantic water. Our analyses of the basin-wide$\backslash$nevolution of the surface pressure and geostrophic wind fields indicate$\backslash$nthat the characteristics of the storms could be very different. The$\backslash$nbuoy-observed mixing occurred only in the spring and winter seasons when$\backslash$nthe stratification was relatively weak. This indicates the importance of$\backslash$nstratification, although the mixing itself was mechanically driven. We$\backslash$nalso analyze the distribution of storms, both the long-term climatology$\backslash$nand the patterns for each year in the past 2 decades. The frequency of$\backslash$nstorms is also shown to be correlated (but not strongly) to Arctic$\backslash$nOscillation indices. This study indicates that the formation of new ice$\backslash$nthat leads to brine rejection is unlikely the mechanism that results in$\backslash$nthe type of mixing that could overturn the halocline. On the other hand,$\backslash$nsynoptic-scale storms can force mixing deep enough to the halocline and$\backslash$nthermocline layer. Despite a very stable stratification associated with$\backslash$nthe Arctic halocline, the warm subsurface thermocline water is not$\backslash$nalways insulated from the mixed layer.},
